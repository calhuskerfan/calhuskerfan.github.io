Some of my favorite quotes, attributed as best I can.

> Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.<br><br>John Wooden

> Success is not gauged  by how many times you fall down, it is gauged  by how many times you get up.<br><br>Jaime Escalante

> Whether you believe  you can or you believe  you can't, you are correct.<br><br>Henry Ford

> Responsibility is a unique concept… You may share it with others, but your portion is not diminished. You may delegate it, but it is still with you… If responsibility is rightfully yours, no evasion, or ignorance or passing the blame can shift the burden to someone else. Unless you can point your finger at the person who is responsible when something goes wrong, then you have never had anyone really responsible.<br><br>Admiral Hyman G. Rickover

> Success has 1000 fathers.  Failure is an Orphan.<br><br>Multiple Variations

> If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.<br><br>Isaac Newton

> Sometimes our big splashes are just ripples in the pool.<br><br>Neal Peart
